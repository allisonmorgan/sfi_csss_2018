Community Detection on Networks II
--------------------------------------------------
Testing inferred communities versus ground truth:
	* "Cluster matching": compute difference between inferred clusters (c^{*}) and ground truth clusters (c)
		
		Use F1 score = count of false positives, false negatives, true positives 
					 = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)
		
		Use normalized mutual information = "how much does knowing one cluster tell you about the others?"

		Use pair counting = cosine-similarity = sin(A, B) = cos(theta) = A * B / (||A|| * ||B||)

Unsupervised machine learning: when you don't know the true labels for the communities
	* Predictive performance: if a model is 'good' if it's able to predict the existence of the network's links

		Use cross-validation: e.g. hide 20% of the edges, fit the parameters on the 80%, calculate the probability of edges on the 20%
			AUC = area under the ROC curve = 1 - (# of bad)/(# edges * # non-edges)
			* Can be used to select the ideal number of clusters, by maximizing AUC

		Use minimum description length: e.g. maximize the minimum description length

Process parameters:
	(1) normalize vectors representing the clusters a node belongs to
	(2) form communities by taking the max for each node, or threshold the membership


Stochastic Biological Systems
--------------------------------------------------
RECAP: "birth-death process". in the limit of large x, find the master equation: a partial difference - differential equation. We then expanded the equation using Taylor series expansion, to resolve that the solution is a Poisson distribution ...

d_{t} p(x, t) = k_{b} * [p(x-1, t) - p(x, t)] + k_{d} * [(x + 1) * p(x + 1, t) - x * p(x, t)]

	(I)   sum_{x = 0, ... } z^{x} * p(x - 1, t) = z * sum_{y = -1, ... } z^{y} * p(y, t) = z * g(z, t)
	(II)  sum_{x} z^{x} * p(x, t) = g(z, t)
	(III) sum_{x} z^{x} * (x + 1) * p(x + 1, t) = sum_{y} z^{y - 1} * y * P(y, t) = dg(z, t) / dz
	(IV)  sum_{x} z^{x} * x * p(x, t) = z * sum_{x} x * z^{x-1} * p(x, t) = z * dg(z, t)/ dz

Master equation for g is:
	dg(z, t) / dt = k_{b} [z * g - g] + k_{d} [dg / dz - z * (dg / dz)]
				  = (z - 1) * [k_{b} * g - k_{d} * dg / dz]					## method of characteristics

@ t = 0, p(x, 0) = delta_{x, 0} 											## Kronecker delta
		 g(z, 0) = 1  														## since p(x, 0) = 1 only when t = 0
@ z = 1, g(z, t) = 1														## since the p(x, t) is normalized

Steady-state solution: when dg(z, t) / dt = 0
	g^{*}(z) = e^{(k_{b} / k_{d}) * (z - 1)} 								## Poission distribution
	p^{*}(x) = e^{-(k_{b} / k_{d}) * x} / x!								
		where standard deviation is sqrt(\lambda^{*}): (sigma / mu) = (1 / sqrt(lambda))

	g(z, t) = e^{lambda(t) * (z - 1)}										## Poission distribution
		where lambda(t) = (k_{b} / k_{d}) * (1 - e^{-k_{d} * t})

Sampling from a time series x(t): need samples drawn a series which are "memory-less".
	To determine the length of memory of the system, consider the autocorrelation function:
		< (x(t + tau) - <x(t+ tau)>) (x(t) - <x(t)>) > ~ exp(-k_{d} * tau)
	where the characteristic time scale, tau is 1 / k^{d}.

FIRST PASSAGE TIMES: consider just the birth process, with linear growth k_{b}. where the stochastic process is monotomically increasing.
	* Only one point at which the process crosses the population threshold. (For other non-monotomically increases processes, we consider the "first" passage time where the threshold is passed just once.)
	
	* Question: Given a process, how do you find the distribution of first passage times? p(x, t) -> p(tau, theta = threshold)
		integral_{0}^{tau} p_{theta}(tau) * delta tau = fraction of cases in which the threshold 
														has been crossed before tau
		p_{theta}(tau) = integral_{0}^{tau}[sum_{0} p(x, t)]

Innovations in Biological Evolution I
--------------------------------------------------
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods can help explore and sample a space of metabolic genotypes
	- perform random walks in the genotype space
	- "flux balance analysis": where each step must preserve phenotype and the number of reactions

Two (qualitative) fundamental features of metabolic genotype space: (1) vast, phenotype-preserving genotype networks that extend far through genotype space, and (2) phenotypically diverse neighborhoods
	Necessary to explore novel phenotypes, while preserving old phenotypes

* Regulatory networks: "gene regulatory circuits create gene expression patterns that are the basis of many adaptations and innovations"

Computational tools: http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/

* Origins of genotype network: evolvable and adaptable technology. limits to the complexity of systems, in the case of adaptation.
