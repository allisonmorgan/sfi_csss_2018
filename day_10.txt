Complex Science of Cybersecurity
--------------------------------------------------
* Malicious behavior emerges spontaneously in complex networks with self-interested actors and adaptation

* Interactions between many actors which have been optimized by different developers

Complex systems perspective on the problem: 
	(a) arms race with adversaries, (b) inadvertant evolution, (c) interactions lead to unanticipated behaviors, (d) network effects, (e) mixed incentives

... and on the solution:
	(a) focus on dynamics, (b) network science, (c) scaling behavior, (d) game theory, (e) evolution / adaptation / competition

Biology + cyber security:
	From compouter science -- "myth of perfection"
	From biology -- constantly coping with adversaries, and developing highly evolved defenses
		where they can (i) automatically detect and respond to attacks, (ii) have learning and memory, (iii) have defense in depth, are (iv) diverse, and have (v) defensive complexity

Engineered diversity: (a) CRISPR inspired signature generation, (b) complex logic circuits
