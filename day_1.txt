=============

Projects:
--------------------------------------------------
- Groups of 3-6, join 1-2 projects
- Presentation + paper


Complex Systems:
--------------------------------------------------
- Characteristics: 1) emergence, 2) interations, 3) order & disorder, 4) heterogeneous, 5) adaptive / dynamic
- How does cooperation occur? How does complexity occur?
- Are there cultural practices and norms common across complex systems scientists?


Project Thoughts:
--------------------------------------------------
- Women in science: interview audit study, interruptions among SFI lectures
- Xindi: predicting / quantifying the success of books
- Convergent cross mapping


Introduction to Nonlinear Dynamics:
--------------------------------------------------
- Examples: double pendulum, eddy both have sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- Chaos: complex behavior arising in a deterministic nonlinear dynamic system, which exhibits two special properties: sensitive dependence and characteristic structure
		Dynamical > Nonlinear > Chaotic
- Nonlinear dynamics: flows, driven nonlinear oscillators (pendula, hearts, firefly), classical mechanics, protein folding, population biology
- Chaotic systems have no closed form / analytical solutions for systems defined by ODEs.
	Necessary: nonlinear, & more than three state-space dimensions
	+ Sufficient: cannot be solved in closed form

- State space: e.g. double pendulum can be defined by theta_1, theta_2, omega_1, omega_2
- Fixed point: stable (perturbations shrink) and unstable (perturbations grow) where a system stays / tends towards
- Attractor: set of state space points to which trajectories relax / asymptotically approach
	Basins of attractors, boundary of basin of attractor, and the attractor
	Four types: (1) fixed points, (2) limit cycle (periodic), (3) quasiperiodic orbit, (4) chaotic / strange attractor (often fractal, but not always; covered densely by trajectories; exponential divergence of neighboring trajectories - SDOIC)
- Transient behavior tends towards attractor (think effects of friction)

- Bifurcation: qualitative change in the dynamics - topological change in the attractor - caused by changes in parameters
- Changes in the location of attractors is a _geometric_ change

- Exponential divergence - distance between two forward images of two nearby points - grows as e^(lambda*t) as t -> infinity, where lambda is the Lyapunov exponent

- If the first Lyapunov exponent is positive, that is a "signature of chaos".
- Lyapunov exponents define the directions along stable and unstable manifold which direction tends
	Stable manifold: direction on the manifold shrink towards a point --->-----<---
	Unstable manifold: direction on manifold diverges 				  ---<----->---
