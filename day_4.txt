Computation I/II: Algorithms & Landscapes
--------------------------------------------------
* "Systems aren't simple or complex; questions about them are."
* "Intrinsic complexity of a problem: the running time (or memory use, or other resource) of the best possible algorithm"

- Duality
- Types of algorithms: dynamic programming, greedy algorithm, linear programming

* Complexity classes: NP (superset of; we can check a solution easily) > P (we can find a solution easily)

* NP-completeness: Any problem in NP, can be re-written as another problem in NP
	- e.g. Boolean circuits -> 3 SAT -> Graph coloring
									 -> Max cut
							-> Tiling
	- Related to a worst-case notion (relevant to cryptography)

"From theory to real world": optimization of a very hard problem can be perturbed to solve an approximation to the problem
	- Problems and algorithms co-evolve naturally (protein folding)


Phase Transitions
--------------------------------------------------
* Statistical inference <=> statistical physics
	- How can we find patterns in noisy data? Phase transitions. Information vs. computation.
		- e.g. magnetic fields in the environment of heat (temperature decreases conductivity and increases noise); 
		- e.g. community detection with noisy data ("ground states vs. the landscape", we need to understand the entire landscape)

* Overfitting: we and our algorithms (community detection) are prone to false positives.
	- Fancy models can nicely explain variance, but is biased (less generalizable)
	- Understanding that the landscape is rocky and not simply convex

Stochastic block model: nodes have discrete labels -- k groups or types of nodes -- generating a k x k matrix of connection probabilities
	- Analogy: phase transition between the connectivity and community structure of a network as a function of the energy / temperature

Belief propagation: probabilistic model explaining message passing: k -> i -> j, where i = p(message | k) and j = p(message | j)
	- Overfitting here could involve fitting each node to its own group, but will not generalizability
	- Uses assumption that network is tree-like, with independence between the inputs

- Phase transition from detectable to undetectable transitions. Above the detectability threshold, there exist efficient algorithms for community detetection.

- Belief propogation for community detetction can fall into a trivial fixed point for almost all initial conditions. (Analogy between spin glass, lowest energy state but unstable -- small basin of attractor.)

- Ideal: "as simple as possible, but no simpler". Everything is a steam engine, computer, economy, ecology, network, etc. Analogies for helping us understand the world better.
