Agent-based modeling for public health
--------------------------------------------------
To uncover complex "etiology", learn from past policy/interventions, to aid deisgn of new policies/interventions via computational laboratory

Artifical society of individuals ("agents"), at any (or multiple) levels of aggregation, where stochastic simulation generates social patterns ("from the bootom up")

"Proposing new interventions ... "
Example #1: Smallpox vaccination across two towns
	* Policy interventions - trace vaccination, mass vaccination, hybrid strategies?
		-> Result: pre-emptive vaccination of hospital workers and family members who have sick family
	- Applications to H1N1, etc.

Example #2: Studying place-based tobacco policy options
	* Particular interest in POS interventions (e.g. retailer density and cost)
		-> Result: ...

" ... retrospectively looking at interventions that don't work ... "
Example #3: Studying "whole of community" obesity prevention interventions
	* Three pillars: (1) focus on community level for effective change, (2) tailoring of evidence based general approach to high precision medicine, (3) complex systems modeling
		-> Result: ... 

" ... and to uncover the causes of an disease."
Example #4: Peer influence - "follow the average" - with respect to body weight
		-> Result: Model shows why and how early exposure can strongly shape reward learning and preference in ways that continue to shape behavior despite later changes in environment
