Behavior and social decision-making (blumsack@psu.edu)
--------------------------------------------------
* Overview: present challenges in (a) aligning individual behavior with sustainable energy, and in (b) governing sustainable power grids

Individual behavior:

- Contagion modesl work well for moding the spread of resistance of rooftop solar power, but not great for describing the propagation of disturbances on the physical network.

"Energy efficiency paradox": people systematically leave money on the table by failing to take actions where the benefits outweigh the costs.

Example: Comparison of energy usage to neighbors & frowny versus smiley faces on energy bills
	- Would it be effective to give everyone frowny faces? Would it be ethical?

"Framing gains and losses" with respect to incentivizing sustainable energy use.

Example: Randomized control trial (opt-in) where users were randomly assigned a rebate "carrot" or a high price "stick" treatments (equal in magnitude) to encourage energy conservation.
	- Result: 
		* Larger reduction among those in the high price "stick" treatment versus those who were given a rebate.
		* What do people value? Monetary savings, but equally improvement in service.
		* But also, why do we care about the carrot or the stick when the gain or loss is roughly a handful of pennies?

Organizational behavior:

RTOs - Regional transmission operations - are responsible for grid reliability but own no physical assets.
	* Rely on markey mechanisms, where rules for markets and planning are devised via a highly stakeholder-driven process.
	* Not for profit, but regulated at the federal level.
	* Decisions made over second to minute time scales - "high reliability operation" (HRO)
	* "Boundary" decisions occur over the longer time scales.

Science of complex power grids: transdisciplinary needs + creative thinking + not just the grid

"What if we wrote down model whose non-uniformity over its ensemble was a feature?""

Generate the structure you wish to infer.
	Generative model (GM) + parameters -- stochastic draw --> data

Stochastic block model is running the generative process in reverse (inference)
	Generative model (GM) + parameters <----- inference ----- data
